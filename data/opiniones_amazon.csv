1,"I tried the pants on when they arrived and they were loose in the waist and legs. I washed them, and now they fit fine in the waist and a little snug in the legs, especially around the ankles. The drawstring in the waist is going to come in handy as they get worn and age. My pants tend to stretch in the waist as they get worn, especially if several days in a row.I'm 6'5"", 290lb, and wear a size 40 jeans, so I bought a size 42 based on the reviews I read. I'm glad I did.  I was concerned about the inseam. but the length of these pants was okay, they fall at the tops of my shoes. After washing, (warm/cold) they shrunk a bit, but not enough to be concerned about. I'm wearing them now, and they feel fine.The material is lighter than I was expecting, so these may end up waiting for spring for regular wear.The only thing I don't like so far is the material for the front inside pockets, which feels stiff and rough. Hopefully that will loosen up as the pants age and the pockets get used. I'm also noticing that the tag on the inside rear of the waistband scratches my back a bit as I move. That may have to go at some point.I will update this review as I wear the pants and report any problems or things I like.Read more",4.1
1,"I am 6'2"" and 188 Lbs. Bought two of these pants and took the advice of others and bought a size up. I am a 34 so bought 36. They both fitted like a very loose 34. Perfect for me with a belt. Length is perfect. All in all sweet pants and well made with heavy material. To be on the safe side buy a size up. Does not come with the belt.Note. Look closely at the different colors as they DO NOT all have the cool little zipper below the front left pocket. If they did I would give 5 out of 5.Read more",3.8

1,"I will echo all the other positive reviews.  I am living in the interior of Panama and mine take a beating but have not disappointed.  There has been a lot written about sizing and my experience was different than other reviewers.  I normally wear a 34"" waist so I ordered a 36"" per many comments.  They are exactly 2"" TOO BIG :-)  I have washed them numerous times but they remain too large.  Thank goodness for the interior drawstring.  I want to buy more but am debating whether to buy my size or continue to follow everyone's advice and buy a size larger.  Other than inconsistent sizing, I think they are great.Read more",3.7

1,"A disadvantage of buying clothes online is that you can't try it out.  This is true with these.  The pants were slightly too long for me as such the drawstrings at the bottom of the pants legs sometimes gets in the way when I'm either walking or sitting down.  Eventually  I was forced to use a scissor and cut these annoyances off.The color was good.  It was exactly as pictured.  The crotch fits with it not being too tight or too large.  There was plenty of pockets for you to store stuff.  The pockets were easy to open and close.  Some of the pockets location caused me to raise an eyebrow as to why the designer placed them there but that didn't bother me.After washing several times, the pants color stayed the same without any fading.  Easy to launder.The fabric was too thick for my taste and if I wore it in the summer, I would wonder how hot it would be and how the fabric would breathe in a hot dry Mediterranean type weather like my hometown.  Again, a drawback of buying clothes online.  If I had a chance to feel the fabric with my fingers, I would not have bought this pair of pants.Nevertheless, I kept them and wear them.  They are nice and warm in cold weather.  Walking in them is comfortable and easy.Read more",4.1
1,"The color I received is STONE (Off White which I like) but the description says (Light Gray) which I would have prefered.  Love everything but the early 1960s tappered legs.  I prefer ""stove pipe"" or equal width from top of thigh to bottom hem.  This is not noticeable from front view but definitely from side view.  This is a problem if you have large calf muscles.  For tighter waist, ties are sewn inside if you prefer No Belt. The pockets are great, deep and heavy duty (inside and out) for wear and tear.  The below knees pockets are angled which look extra cool.  Nice heavy cotton pants.  Since my legs are longer than my torso, the pants will not be too long after wash/dry shrinkage.  The pants cuffs have ties if you dont want the pants to ride past top of shoes.  The cargo pants look ""dress casual"" at least ironed.  Good purchase.  This is Matchstick brand.Read more",4.5
1,"Not a good pants due to cut. I would not buy these again.  The one pair I bought are already in the donation binThe pants seem to be cut for a very tall and skinny person.  I'm average height and more on the husky side (OK Fat, just step away from my donuts on nobody gets hurt!)The legs are cut narrow and the waist very long.  When worn with a belt at my waist, the inseam was about 4 inches below my crotch.  Combined with the very slim cut of the legs, these became tiring to walk around in.  Like having a belt high around my thighs.  In order for the inseam to wear at the proper fit, I had to hike the pants waist way above my belly button.  I even tried rolling the top over around the belt like a cuff at the top of the pants instead of the bottom of the pants leg...... at which time I just gave up on these and someone at Good Will may find them a better fit.Read more",4.1

For tighter waist, ties are sewn inside if you prefer No Belt. The pockets are great, deep and heavy duty (inside and out) for wear and tear.

When worn with a belt at my waist, the inseam was about 4 inches below my crotch.  Combined with the very slim cut of the legs, these became tiring to walk around in.
